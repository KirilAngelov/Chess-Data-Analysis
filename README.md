# Chess-Data-Analysis
Project about exploring, analysing and transforming chess data.

### Current state of the project
For now the project is finished. It has some small mistakes which will be fixed.

Another thing to add is finding more data for analysis of percentage of active players from the population of the whole country. This will give us even more insight, mainly because this way will can find in which country chess is more popular.
